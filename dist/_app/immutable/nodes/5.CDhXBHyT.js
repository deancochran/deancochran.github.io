			solutions that solve real-world problems. With a background in data science, machine learning,
			and cloud computing, I thrive at the intersection of technology and creativity. I enjoy
			working on projects that challenge me to think critically and continue evolving my skills.</p> <p>When I’m not coding, you’ll find me outdoors, cycling, running, or taking part in endurance
			sports like triathlons. As a remote software engineer, I value a healthy work-life balance
			that allows me to pursue my passion for nature and adventure while still delivering
			high-quality work. This balance fuels my creativity and keeps me at my best.</p> <p>Thanks for stopping by—feel free to connect or explore my work further!
