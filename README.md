# Howdy y'all, I'm deancochran

> I edit text files for a living, and race bikes sometimes

This is my portfolio website that I use to send to clients or other interested parties when they haven't yet seen my work. The project is ongoing as there will always be something to change, but for now, I'm content with the tech stack that I picked.

# Objetivos

- for every post made in English, I will post one in Spanish
- for every post, I will write a minimum word total of 250
- continue developing the look and feel of posts as the project grows
