# Hi, I’m Dean Cochran

I am a full-stack software engineer with a passion for building innovative
solutions that solve real-world problems. With a background in data science, machine learning,
and cloud computing, I thrive at the intersection of technology and creativity. I enjoy
working on projects that challenge me to think critically and continue evolving my skills.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me outdoors, cycling, running, or taking part in endurance
sports like triathlons. As a remote software engineer, I value a healthy work-life balance
that allows me to pursue my passion for nature and adventure while still delivering
high-quality work. This balance fuels my creativity and keeps me at my best.
