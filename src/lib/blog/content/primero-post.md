title: My first Spanish post
description: Learning new languages has never been my best ability. However language barriers have caused myself enough discomfort in life to rethink my goals. Spanish may take a lifetime for me to master, but to stop any attempt in learning would just limit my potential. I hope to learn spanish gradually, through speaking at group lessons, stufying online material, and writing my thoughts down in spanish via this blog.
