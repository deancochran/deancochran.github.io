title: How I made this website 
description: I often make projects with efficiency in mind. On rare occasions I find myself taking the more creative approach, shifting through options, and weighing out decisions. From my personal experience, I'll provide a note on what tools I used to program this website, the issues I had, and my solutions to end up with what you see now.
